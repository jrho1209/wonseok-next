          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A native of Seoul, South Korea, <strong>Wonseok Lee</strong> is a PhD candidate in ethnomusicology. His academic interests include popular music, globalization, transnationalism, and musical identity.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          His current research focuses on the exact meaning of <em>"K"</em> in K-pop â€” particularly in the context of non-Korean members and non-Korean languages, which are now common in the genre. Despite these transnational features, the term "K-pop" still carries assumptions of a specific ethnicity and language.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          His work has been presented at prestigious international conferences, including the International Association for the Study of Popular Music (IASPM), Popular Culture Association (PCA), Society for Ethnomusicology (SEM), and the Association for Asian Studies (AAS).
